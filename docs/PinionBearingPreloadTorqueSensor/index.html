		<p><span style="font-size: 13pt">During end 2012 / spring 2013, when 
		driving&nbsp; with my VW Bus T3,&nbsp;&nbsp; a&nbsp; blustering noise 
		could be heared clearly, coming out of the front transmission of the 4WD 
		T3 Syncro. It was clear that a general overhaul of the front 
		transmission had to be done. Thanks to the intensive help of two 
		friends, mainly concerning the physically straining parts of the work 
		which I could never do with my affected backbone, it was so far possible 
		to do this work on my own. Repairing a transmission means mainly having 
		available a lot of special tools. A lot of them I could already find in&nbsp; my collection. 
		Then, some of the missing tools I could buy, 
		but many of them I had to create myself because they are hardly 
		available. A long time I was looking for a matching torque meter whose 
		range and construction allows to measure the preload torque of pinion 
		bearings.</span></p>
		<p><span style="font-size: 13pt">One day by chance, I found a second 
		hand high 
		precision Lebow torque sensor in the range of +/- 600 Ncm - exactly the 
		range needed for our purpose. So I decided to create also this special 
		tool on my own. The idea of the construction is to have a hand-tool part 
		consisting of torquesensor plus electronics installed on a crank handle 
		where one can turn around the pinion bearings built in the transmission.&nbsp;This 
		hand tool sends the sensor values via rs232-radio transmission to the 
		display placed aside in the field of sight of the operator. The hand 
		tool electronics-processor, an ATMega328, was programmed using AVR 
		Studio 5.1 and the display part was developed using QNX Momentics IDE.</span></p>
